Basic ESP8266 WeMos Shield
==========================

This shield is used to quickly do some tests/boards with WeMos ESP8266 boards it has just few minimal features.
- I2C Pullups placement
- Classic I2C 128x64 OLED connector
- pad to solder components if needed to
- N-FET placement for 1 signal adapter such as 5V to 3V3

You can find more information on WeMos on their [site][1], it's really well documented.
I now use WeMos boards instead of NodeMCU's one because they're just smaller, features remains the same, but I also suspect WeMos regulator far better quality than the one used on NodeMCU that are just fake of originals AMS117 3V3.

*Boards are ordered as testing from OSHPark, I did not fully tested them yet, I will update as soon has I got them in my hands. Use at your own risks*
